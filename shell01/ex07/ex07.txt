Let's break down the given command step by step:

cat /etc/passwd:
Displays the content of the /etc/passwd file, which contains information about user accounts.

grep -v '^#':
Excludes lines starting with #, filtering out comment lines.

awk 'FNR % 2 == 0':
Selects only the lines with an even line number, effectively filtering out every other line.

cut -d ':' -f1:
Uses cut to split each line into fields using : as the delimiter and extracts the first field. In the context of the /etc/passwd file, the first field is the username.

rev:
Reverses each line.

sort -r:
Sorts the lines in reverse order (descending order).

awk 'FNR >= ENVIRON["FT_LINE1"] && FNR <= ENVIRON["FT_LINE2"]':
Uses awk to print lines within a specified range defined by FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2. These values should be set in the environment before running the command.

tr '\n' ',':
Translates newline characters to commas.

sed 's/,/, /g':
Uses sed to add a space after each comma.

sed 's/, $/./':
Uses sed to replace the last comma with a period.

In summary, this command processes the /etc/passwd file to extract usernames, reverse, sort, and format them within a specified range, and then outputs a comma-separated list with spaces and a period at the end. The actual output depends on the content of the /etc/passwd file and the values of FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2.
